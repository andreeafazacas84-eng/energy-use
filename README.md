# Energy Use Trends Analysis

This project explores trends in energy consumption using real-world datasets and Python. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization, it uncovers patterns in usage and delivers insights into energy behavior over time.

## Features & Highlights

- Data preprocessing and transformation  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) across multiple dimensions  
- Visualizations (line charts, histograms, trend comparisons)  
- Clean, reproducible analysis using Jupyter Notebook  

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)  
- Jupyter Notebook for code + narrative  
- (Optional) Exported visuals or dashboards
